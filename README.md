# DevCycle Integration Hooks

This repository contains the integration hooks for DevCycle SDKs made as a drop in hook for your current applications.

These hooks are designed to send feature flag evaluation traces to your observability platform.

There are language specific folders for each SDK and there are usage examples for each language. You can copy the hook files into your project and add them to your DevCycle client. You can also use the hooks as a reference to implement your own hook.

## Example Hooks for SDKs:

- [java](java)
- [.NET](dotnet)
